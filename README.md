# About the project
DailyWins is a web application to implement a concept from the book 'The Gap and The Gain: The High Achievers' Guide to Happiness, Confidence, and Success'.
The concept is basically you record your gains/wins: what you have accomplished today and what are your targets for tomorrow. You do this everyday
so you can feel more empowered for that day and consciously structure your next day to achieve what you want to set.

The programming stack used is the PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. In addition, it implements bcrypt for hashing user passwords and JWT (JSONWebToken)
for user authentication.

The user interface is based on Silicon Design System: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084696620401606945.

This is a solo project to practice and demonstrate my design (using Figma), frontend (React), and backend (PostgreSQL, Express, and Node) abilities.

# Live website
You can use the application directly at https://daily-wins.vercel.app/. The frontend is hosted at Vercel and the backend is hosted at Heroku.
